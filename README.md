# PulsePoint Incident Downloader

A Next.js web application for downloading and analyzing emergency incident data from PulsePoint, a real-time emergency response platform used by fire departments and EMS agencies across the United States.

## üö® Overview

PulsePoint provides real-time emergency incident information to the public through their mobile app and API. This application allows users to:

- **Fetch incident data** from any PulsePoint-enabled emergency agency
- **View incidents** in both summary and detailed JSON formats
- **Export data** as JSON or CSV files for analysis
- **Decrypt encrypted API responses** automatically
- **Process and normalize** incident data with proper date/time handling

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Functionality
- **Agency-based Data Retrieval**: Enter any valid PulsePoint agency ID to fetch incident data
- **Real-time Decryption**: Automatically decrypts PulsePoint's AES-256-CBC encrypted API responses
- **Dual Data Views**: Toggle between summary statistics and raw JSON data
- **Export Options**: Download data as formatted JSON or CSV files
- **Data Processing**: Converts timestamps, maps incident types, and adds coordinate arrays

### Data Categories
- **Active Incidents**: Currently ongoing emergency responses
- **Recent Incidents**: Recently completed incidents
- **Incident Types**: Medical emergencies, fires, traffic collisions, hazmat, rescue operations, and more

### User Interface
- **Modern Design**: Clean, responsive interface built with Tailwind CSS
- **Real-time Feedback**: Loading states and error handling
- **Data Visualization**: Summary statistics and formatted JSON display
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Easy sharing of JSON data

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Frontend (Next.js 15.2.4)
- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS 4** for styling
- **Client-side data processing** and export functionality
- **Responsive design** with modern UI components

### Backend API Routes
- **`/api/incidents`**: Fetches and decrypts incident data from PulsePoint
- **`/api/agencies`**: Retrieves available emergency agencies
- **AES-256-CBC decryption** with custom key derivation algorithm

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. **API Request**: Fetch encrypted data from PulsePoint API
2. **Decryption**: Decrypt using derived AES-256-CBC key
3. **Normalization**: Convert timestamps and map incident types
4. **Enhancement**: Add coordinate arrays and unique identifiers
5. **Export**: Format for JSON or CSV download

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd pulsepoint-incident-downloader
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**

   ```

4. **Open in browser**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Production Deployment

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

The application is configured for standalone deployment with optimized builds.

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Finding Agency Codes
Agency codes are numeric identifiers for emergency services. Common examples:
- `05900` - Alexandria Fire Department, VA (default)
- `1441` - Los Angeles Fire Department, CA
- Use the agency search feature to find specific departments

### Downloading Data

1. **Enter Agency Code**: Input the numeric agency identifier
2. **Fetch Incidents**: Click "Fetch Incidents" to retrieve current data
3. **View Results**: Toggle between Summary and Raw JSON views
4. **Export Data**: 
   - **Download JSON**: Complete incident data with metadata
   - **Download CSV**: Spreadsheet-friendly format with key fields

### CSV Export Fields
- **ID**: Unique incident identifier
- **CallReceivedDateTime**: When the emergency call was received
- **ClosedDateTime**: When the incident was resolved
- **PulsePointIncidentCallType**: Type of emergency (mapped to readable format)
- **Latitude/Longitude**: Incident coordinates
- **Units**: Emergency response units assigned
- **Location**: Full address or location description

### Incident Type Mapping
The application maps PulsePoint's abbreviated codes to readable descriptions:
- `ME` ‚Üí Medical Emergency
- `TC` ‚Üí Traffic Collision  
- `FA` ‚Üí Fire Alarm
- `VF` ‚Üí Vehicle Fire
- `RF` ‚Üí Residential Fire
- `HMR` ‚Üí Hazmat Response
- And many more...

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Setup
The application works out-of-the-box with no additional environment variables required. All API endpoints are proxied through Next.js API routes.

### Customization Options
- **Default Agency**: Modify the default agency code in `app/page.tsx`
- **Incident Types**: Update mappings in `public/incident_types.json`
- **Export Fields**: Customize CSV fields in the download handler
- **Styling**: Modify Tailwind classes for different visual themes

## üìä Data Structure

### Incident Object
```typescript
interface Incident {
  ID: string;
  CallReceivedDateTime: string;
  ClosedDateTime: string | null;
  PulsePointIncidentCallType: string;
  Latitude: string;
  Longitude: string;
  Unit?: Unit[];
  FullDisplayAddress?: string;
  // Enhanced fields added during processing
  coords?: [number, number];
  uid?: string;
  incident_type?: string;
}
```

### Response Structure
```typescript
interface Incidents {
  active: Incident[];  // Currently ongoing incidents
  recent: Incident[];  // Recently completed incidents
}
```

## üîê Security & Decryption

The application implements PulsePoint's proprietary decryption algorithm:

1. **Password Generation**: Creates decryption key from hardcoded string pattern
2. **Key Derivation**: Uses MD5 hashing with salt for AES key generation  
3. **AES-256-CBC**: Decrypts incident data using derived key and initialization vector
4. **Data Parsing**: Processes decrypted JSON and handles escape characters

**Note**: This decryption method is reverse-engineered from PulsePoint's client-side JavaScript and is used for legitimate data access purposes.
